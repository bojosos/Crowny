In order to build a game
I will need:
  Package the resources - Asset manager
  Save the scene as binary - Faster, smaller size 
  Compile the scripts without debug option
  Run the mono runtime without debug options. No point in debugging the garabage collector
  Have a runtime project. Or just packaged with the engine. In order for the game to run I would need to somehow link the core engine and all the libraries
  Currently Crowny-Editor links against Crowny
  For C# scripting I am using Crowny-Sharp for the interop classes
  And Crowny-Sandbox is just a project that compiles into a dll and moves the dll into the Resources folder
  This is no good if I want to package a game

Add search by tag to c#
