![C/C++ CI](https://github.com/bojosos/Crowny/workflows/Crowny-Editor/badge.svg) ![Crowy-Sharp](https://github.com/bojosos/Crowny/workflows/Crowy-Sharp/badge.svg)

A C++ game engine

GOAL: Run the same code I wrote in a Minecraft clone I made in Unity with Crowny

### Features:
  * Editor
  * C# scripting using Mono
  * PBR
  * OpenGL, Vulkan
  * Windows, Linux
  
### Roadmap:
  * Refactor OpenGL
  * Multithreading? (Firstly only "queable" tasks (async resource loading, audio streaming, then whole engine))
  * Implement 3D physics using PhysX
  * Proper material system and shadows
  * Documentation
  * Game builds (I have a "usable" engine here)
  * Big refactor/clean up
