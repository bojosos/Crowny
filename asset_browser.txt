I want:
	Drag drop
	Backwards, forwads history
	Thumbnails
	Search (with modes - current dir, assets dir, regex)
	We want shift select, ctrl select
	Renaming
	Arrow select and shift + arrows to select items around us
	Context menus (for items, directories and in editor only)
	Deselect only editor click
	Creation of items (scripts, folders, materials)
	Open directory, in default editor
	Open C# projects when clicking on scripts

	* Opening treeview entries using the arrow changes the current dir
	* Add drag drop stuff to single function for treeview and normal view
	* Tree view create folder and enter opens C# script in vs code
	* When creating a folder the treeview collapses weirdly
	* Folders with same names get selected together
	* Add common key interface for treeview and normal view
	Maybe the selected item I save in the project is not getting selected when loading the asset browser
	* Select folder after rename
	* Unique names in asset browser please
	* Renaming(also creating new stuff) can create same name entries
	Maybe rename the Hash function to perhaps include the method
	* Convert to ImGui key presses
	Add second selection set for treeview
	* Normal view to tree view sync
	Multiple item drag drops
	Shift move around select
	* Enter still does weird stuff
	Rework image stuff to be like in Big Hazel
	* Possible to use backward/forward mouse buttons when renaming
	Scroll the asset browser when using arrow keys
	* Maybe remove the padding scaling
	Fix same name folders getting selected together when using search
	Add span width to treeview
	Replace memcpy with CW_Copy
	* Need a proper display list, not just the children, so copy the refs
